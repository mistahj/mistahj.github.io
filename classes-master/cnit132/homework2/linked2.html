    <h1>Linked Style Sheet Example 2</h1>

    <p class="first">The average adult human brain weighs about 3 pounds â€“ the same weight as the average brain
      of a dolphin (which is also a very intelligent animal). But there are animals with larger brains that are
      not considered to be as intelligent as a dolphin. For instance, a sperm whale has a brain that weighs
      about 17 pounds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_size">More Brain facts.</a></p>

    <p class="second">When Neptune and Earth line up on the same side of the sun, at their closest, they are only
      2.7 billion miles (4.3 billon kilometers) apart. But when the planets are on opposite sides of the sun,
      they can put as many as 2.9 billion miles (4.7 billion km) between them</p>

    <p class="third">For my second homework assignment, there was an extra credit assignment. The assignment was to make a page with embedded
    css, which used CSS3. Check out my <a target="_blank" href="http://hills.ccsf.edu/~jsmit175/embedded2.html">Extra Credit Page</a>.</p>
